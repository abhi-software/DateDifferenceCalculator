Date Difference Reporting Tool is a java application that reads an input of dates from a text file.   
  
Dates in the input file are in this format:   
DD MM YYYY, DD MM YYYY 

The tool validates the input data according to the supplied format and computes the difference in days between the two supplied dates.  

A new file is created having the following output:  
DD MM YYYY, DD MM YYYY, difference  
Where:  
• the first date is the earliest,     
• the second date is the latest,  
• and the difference is the number of days.
